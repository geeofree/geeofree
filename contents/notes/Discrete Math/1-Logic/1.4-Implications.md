## Implications
A logical connective that operates on two statements in which 
one of the statements is called the *hypothesis* statement and 
the other statement is called the *conclusion* statement. 

An implication is only false if the given *hypothesis* statement 
is true while the given *conclusion* statement is false.

$$P \implies Q$$

## Converse
An implication where the conclusion and hypothesis statements are 
swapped.

$$Q \implies P$$

## Contrapositive
An implication where the conclusion and hypothesis statements are 
swapped and negated.

$$\lnot Q \implies \lnot P$$

A contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication.

$$\lnot Q \implies \lnot P \equiv P \implies Q$$

## Biconditional
A conjunction between an implication and its converse.

$$P \Longleftrightarrow Q$$
