## Compound Statements
Are statements that are constructed from other statements.

## Logical Equivalency
Is when two distinct statements have the same truth values 
for the same set of given inputs.

## Commutative Law
States that the conjunction or disjunction of two given 
statements is logical equivalent regardless of their ordering.

## De Morgan's Law
States two things for two distinct statements *P* and *Q*:

1. The **negation of a conjunction statement** between *P* and 
*Q* is logically equivalent to the disjunction of *P* and *Q* 
in negation.

  $$\lnot(P \land Q) \equiv \lnot P \lor \lnot Q$$

2. The **negation of a disjunction statement** between *P* and 
*Q* is logically equivalent to the conjunction of *P* and *Q* 
in negation.

  $$\lnot(P \lor Q) \equiv \lnot P \land \lnot Q$$

## Associative Law
For three or more statements, the conjunction or disjunction of 
these statements is logically equivalent regardless of how they 
are grouped.

## Distributive Law
For three statements *P*, *Q*, and *R*:

1. $$P \land (Q \lor R) \equiv (P \land Q) \lor (P \land R)$$
2. $$P \lor (Q \land R) \equiv (P \lor Q) \land (P \lor R)$$
