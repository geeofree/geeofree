## Union
For two sets *A* and *B*: A union is a set operator that 
operates on two sets and contains all elements that are 
either in *A* or in *B*.

$$A \cup B = \{x | x \in A \lor x \in B\}$$

## Intersection
For two sets *A* and *B*: An intersection is a set operator 
that operates on two sets and contains all elements that 
are common in both *A* and *B*.

$$A \cap B = \{x | x \in A \land x \in B\}$$

## Disjoint Sets
Are two sets that have no common elements.

$$A \cap B = \emptyset$$

## Pairwise Disjoint Sets
In a list of sets where all pairs of sets have no common elements 
with each other.

## Set Difference
For two sets *A* and *B*: The set difference is a set operator that 
operates on two sets which contains all elements that are in *A* but 
and are not in *B*.

$$A - B = \{x | x \in A \land x \notin B\}$$

## Symmetric Difference
For two sets *A* and *B*: A symmetric difference is a set operator that 
operates on two sets which contains all elements that are unique in *A* 
or all elements that are unique in *B* but not both.

$$A \oplus B = \{x | (x \in A \lor x \in B) \land x \notin (A \land B) \}$$

## Complement
A set operator that operates on a single set and contains all elements that 
are in some given universal set minus all the elements from the complemented 
set.
