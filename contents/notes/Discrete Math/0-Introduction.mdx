I wanted to have a good background for learning algorithms 
and data structures so I thought I'd first go through 
Discrete Mathematics before I tackle those topics. 

Suffice to say I've learnt a lot from the material I'm taking 
â€” got to know several important concepts such as the basics of 
logical reasoning, connectives, and different proof methods, I've
also learned basic counting methodologies and structures such as 
sets, relations, graphs, and matrices.

The book I'm using as my reference material is [Discrete Mathematics 
by Gary Chartrand and Ping Zhang](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Gary-Chartrand/dp/1577667301) 
which I think is the best book to use when self-learning Discrete Mathematics. 
It's got a good outline on what to learn: you start from learning the fundamental
concepts which are Logic, Sets, Proof Methods, Induction, and Relations and Functions, 
and from there on you can go onto other topics, for my case I went to learn Counting 
and then Graph Theory.

Hopefully when I finish the book I've learnt enough to get a better 
grasp when I'm learning algorithms and data structures.
