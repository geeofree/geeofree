## Proofs
Are as presentation of logical arguments that demonstrates 
the truth value of a given statement

## Direct Proof
A proof method that shows that an implication is true by 
assuming that the hypothesis is true which then logically 
deduces that the conclusion is true as well.

## Proof by Contrapositive
Same as a direct proof but the hypothesis and conclusion are 
negated and swapped.

## Proof of Biconditionals
To prove biconditionals, the implication in conjunction with 
its converse must be shown to be both true.

## Proof by Cases
A proof method in which a set of cases (usually by partitioning
the problem domain) must hold for a given statement.

## Counterexamples
A proof method that shows that a given statement is false by 
providing at least one element to show that the given statement 
is false.

## Existential Proofs
A proof method that shows that a given statement is true by 
providing at least one element to show that the given statement 
is true.

## Proof by Contradiction
A proof method in which when assuming that a given statement is 
false results in a contradiction (therefore the statement cannot 
be false and must be true).
