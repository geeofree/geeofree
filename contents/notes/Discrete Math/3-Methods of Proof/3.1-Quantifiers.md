## Quantifiers
Are words or symbols that denotes the amount of elements in 
which a given statement must hold into.

## Universal Quantifier
Is a quantifier that denotes that all elements must hold for 
a given statement.

## Existential Quantifier
Is a quantifier that denotes that at least one element must 
hold for a given statement.

## Negations of Quantifiers
1. The *negation of a universal quantifier* is the existential 
   quantifier in which the given statement is false.
   
   $$\lnot(\forall P(x)) \equiv \exists \lnot P(x)$$

2. The *negation of an existential quantifier* is the universal 
   quantifier in which the given statement is false.

   $$\lnot(\exists P(x)) \equiv \forall \lnot P(x)$$
