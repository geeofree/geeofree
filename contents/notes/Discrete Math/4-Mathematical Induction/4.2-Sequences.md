## Sequences
Are a list of *terms* where each term is generated from some 
kind of expression.

## Geometric Sequences
Are sequences where each term is multiplied by some common ratio.

## Arithmetic Sequences
Are sequences where each term is added by some common difference.

## Recursively-Defined Sequences
Are sequences that contain initial terms and where succeeding terms 
are generated by evaluating an expression that contains preceding 
terms in the sequence.

## Strings
Are finite sequences.
