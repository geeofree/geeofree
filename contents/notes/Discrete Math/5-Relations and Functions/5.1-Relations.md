## Relations
Are a set of ordered pairs where each ordered pair is 
based on how elements from two sets are related to one 
another.

## Homogenuous Relations
Is a relations over some set with itself.

## Properties of Relations
Given homogenous relation *R* over some set *S*, this relation 
is said to be:

1. **Reflexive** if for any element in *S*, then that element 
   must be related to itself.

   $$R = \{x \in S | x R x\}$$

2. **Symmetric** if for two distinct elements *a* and *b* in *S*, 
   if *a* is related to *b*, then *b* is related to *a*.

3. **Transitive** if for three elements *a*, *b*, and *c* in *S*,
   if *a* is related to *b* and *b* is related to *a*, then *a* 
   must be related to *c*.
