## Functions
Are a type of relation that contains an *input* set and an 
*output* set where each element in the *input* set must be 
related to **at most one** element in the *output* set.

## Domain
The set of input elements for a function.

## Codomain
The set of output elements for a function.

## Image
An element in the codomain derived from some element in the 
domain of a function.

## Range
The set of images for a function.

## Common Functions
1. **Identity Function**
2. **Absolute Function**
3. **Ceil Function**
4. **Floor Function**
5. **Exponent Function**
6. **Logarithm Function**

## Injective Functions (One-to-One Functions)
Are functions where each element in the domain is related to 
distinct elements in the codomain

## Surjective Functions (Onto Functions)
Are functions where each element in the codomain is related to 
at least one element from the domain.

## Bijective Functions
Are functions that are *injective* and *surjective* all at once.

## Inverse Functions
Are bijective functions where the domain and codomain are swapped.
