## Matrix
A rectangular array of elements.

## Matrix Size
The total number of elements which is the product of 
rows by columns.

## Square Matrix
A matrix that contains the same number of rows as the 
columns.

## Zero-One Matrix
A matrix that contains binary numbers only.

## Sum of Matrices
For two matrices *A* and *B* that have the same number 
of rows and columns:

$$A + B = [a_{i,j} + b_{i,j}]$$

## Row Matrix
A matrix that has a single row and multiple columns.

## Column Matrix
A matrix that has a single column and multiple rows.

## Inner Product
For a row matrix *A* and a column matrix *B*:

$$A * B = a_{1}b_{1} + a_{2}b_{2} + a_{3}b_{3} + ... + a_{n}b_{n} = \sum_{i=1}^n a_{i}b_{i}$$

## Matrix Product
For a matrix *A* that has a size *m x n* and a matrix *B* that 
has a size *n x p*:

$$A * B = a_{i1}b_{1k} + a_{i2}b_{2k} + ... + a_{in}b_{nk}  = \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}b_{jk}$$

Where 

$1 \leq i \leq m, 1 \leq k \leq p$

## Adjacency Matrix
A square and zero-one matrix that denotes the adjacencies of each vertex in a row by column 
definition.
