## Degrees
The total number of neighbors for some vertex.

## Leaf Vertex
A vertex that has only one degree.

## Isolated Vertex
A vertex that has no degrees.

## Maximum Degree
The largest degree in some graph.

## Minimum Degree
The smallest degree in some graph.

## Even and Odd Vertices
- An *odd vertex* contains an odd number of degrees.
- An *even vertex* contains an even number of degrees.

## First Theorem of Graph Theory
States that the total number of degrees in some graph is 
twice the size of that graph.

**Corollary:** There are an even number of odd vertices.
See [this video](https://youtu.be/M9rM0FADP-Q) for proof.

## Regular Graphs
Are graphs where each vertex has the same number of degrees.
