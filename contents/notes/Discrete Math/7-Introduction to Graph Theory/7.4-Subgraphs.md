## Subgraphs
For two graphs *G* and *H*: *G* is a subgraph of *H* if its vertices 
and edges are a subset of the vertices and edges in *H*.

## Proper Subgraphs
For two graphs *G* and *H*: *G* is a proper subgraph of *H* if its 
vertices and edges are a proper subset of the vertices and edges in *H*.

## Induced Subgraphs
For a subgraph *G* of *H*: if for any two vertices in *G* that are adjacent
then they must be adjacent in *H* as well.

## Spanning Subgraphs
For two graphs *G* and *H*: *G* is a spanning subgraph of *H* if it 
contains the same vertices as *H*.
