## Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
A protocol for automatically assigning IP addresses to hosts in a 
network using a range of pre-configured addresses.

## Network Address Translation (NAT)
Is a router service used for translating network private addresses 
to public addresses and vice versa.

This is important in minimizing the number of public IPv4 addresses 
being used in the world.

Also hides the host address in a private network.

There are three types of NAT:
1. **Static Network Address Translation (SNAT)** is a 1-to-1 mapping
   of private addresses to public addresses.

2. **Dynamic Network Adddress Translation (DNAT)** is a dynamic mapping 
   of private addresses to some available public addresses.

3. **Port Address Translation (PAT)** translates many private addresses 
   using a single public address differentiated by their ports.
