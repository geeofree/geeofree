## Star Topology
A physical topology in which end systems connect to a central 
node system ie a switch.

## Bus Topology
A physical topology in which end systems are connected 
contiguously.

## Star-Bus Topology
Also called "daisy-chain topology", is a physical topology 
where networks in a star topology are connected to other 
networks or end-systems via a bus topology.

## Mesh Topology
A physical topology in which end-systems are connected with 
other end-systems, forming a mesh network.

## Ring Topology
Is an outdated topology where each end system is connected 
to two other end systems and can only communicate if one 
of the end system contains a "token".
