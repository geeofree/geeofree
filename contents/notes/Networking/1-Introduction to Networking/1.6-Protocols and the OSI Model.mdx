## Protocols
Are a set of methods and rules for communication.

## OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model
Is a suite of network protocols containing seven layers.

## Application Layer (Layer 7)
Describes the interface that provides a service for users 
to use. The data that comes out of this layer is called the 
*payload*.

## Presentation Layer (Layer 6)
Describes how the *payload* from the application layer gets 
reformatted, compressed, and/or encrypted.

## Session Layer (Layer 5)
Describes how data between two applications are synced and 
recovered if messages don't arrived intact at the receiving 
application.

## Transport Layer (Layer 4)
Describes how the application *payload* gets transported 
to the other application. This layer provides two services, 
namely:

- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** is a connection-oriented 
  transport protocol meaning it guarantees that messages between
  end-systems are sent and received successfully in whole. The 
  data that comes out of this protocol is called a *segment*.

- **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)** is a connectionless transport 
  protocol meaning it only provides a *best-effort* transport of 
  the payload to the receiving end-system â€” parts of the payload 
  may drop using this protocol. The data that comes out of this 
  protocol is called a *datagram*.

## Network Layer (Layer 3)
Describes how the *segment* or *datagram* gets delivered to other 
nodes in the network. The data that comes out of this layer is 
called a *packet*.

## Data-Link Layer (Layer 2)
Describes the protocol to use based on the underlying physical 
medium, ie. ethernet for wired and wi-fi for wireless. The data 
that comes out of this layer is called a *frame*.

## Physical Layer (Layer 1)
Is the physical medium that the computer system is connected with.

## Protocol Data Unit (PDU)
Fancy term for each data output in every layer.
