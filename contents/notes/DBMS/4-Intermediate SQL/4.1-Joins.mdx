## Join Types
1. **INNER JOIN** joins two relations and removes records that are 
   not valid in the join.

2. **LEFT OUTER JOIN** joins relations and preserves records from 
   the left relation of the join construct that are not valid. 

3. **RIGHT OUTER JOIN** joins relations and preserves records from 
   the right relation of the join construct that are not valid. 

4. **FULL OUTER JOIN** joins relations and preserves records from 
   both the left and right relations of the join construct that are 
   not valid. 

**NOTE:** `INNER JOIN` is the default if the join keyword `OUTER` is 
omitted.

## Join Conditions
1. **NATURAL** joins two relations using attributes that are the same 
   in both relations.

2. **USING** joins two relations using defined attributes.

3. **ON** joins two relations using a predicate.
