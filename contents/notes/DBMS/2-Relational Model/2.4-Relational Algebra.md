## Select Operation
Returns a relation based from a given predicate.

$$\sigma_{predicate}(Relation)$$

## Project Operation
Returns a relation with the specified attributes.

$$\Pi_{attributes}(Relation)$$

## Composition of Relational Operators
Is the concept in which relational operators can be composed by providing a result 
relation as the input of another relational operator.

## Cartesian Product
Returns a relation that is a combination of tuples from two relations.

$$R \times S$$

## Join
Returns a relation that contains similar rows from two relations.

$$R \Join_{predicate} S$$

## Set Operations
Other than the operators discussed above, set operations can also be used to operate 
on relational sets. Specifically

- **Union** returns records that are in one relation or the other relation.
- **Intersection** returns records that are common in both relations.
- **Set Difference** returns records that are unique in one relation and none on the other.

## Assignment Operator
Puts results of a relation in a temporary variable.

$$some\_relation\_variable\_name \leftarrow Relation$$

## Rename Operator
Provides a name to a relation.

$$\rho_x(Relation)$$

Where *x* is the name of the resulting relation.
