## SQL Query Structure

```sql
SELECT attr(1), attr(2), attr(3), ..., attr(n)
FROM tbl(1), tbl(2), tbl(3), ..., tbl(n)
WHERE [predicate]
```

## Renaming Clause
The **as** operator can rename an attribute from a `SELECT` clause or 
a table name in the `FROM` clause.

```sql
SELECT some_attribute AS some_other_name
FROM table_name AS some_other_table_name
```

## String Matching
Strings can be matched using the `LIKE` operator in a `WHERE` clause.

```sql
SELECT full_name FROM people WHERE full_name LIKE '%Ge_'
```

## Ordering Clause
The `ORDER BY` clause can be used to sort a relation based on a value for
any attribute(s).

```sql
SELECT full_name
FROM people
ORDER BY age
```
