## Common Aggregate Functions
- **avg**
- **sum**
- **count**
- **min**
- **max**

## Grouping Records
To group records based on their attribute values, use the `GROUP BY` clause.

```sql
SELECT city, avg(age)
FROM people
GROUP BY city
```

**Note:** If `GROUP BY` is omitted, then the default is to treat all the queried
records as a single group.

**Note:** Only attributes found in the `GROUP BY` clause or aggregated attributes can 
be selected in the `SELECT` clause.

## Filtering Groups
To filter groups, use the `HAVING` clause.

```sql
SELECT city
FROM people
GROUP BY city
HAVING avg(age) > 10
```

## Order of Operations
1. `FROM` 
2. `WHERE`
3. `GROUP BY`
4. `HAVING`
5. `ORDER BY`
6. `SELECT`
