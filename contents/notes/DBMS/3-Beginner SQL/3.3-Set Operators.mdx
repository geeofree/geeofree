## Union Operator
Two relations can be unioned using the `UNION` operator.

```sql

UNION
(SELECT full_name FROM people WHERE age < 10)
```

## Intersection Operator
Two relations can be intersected using the `INTERSECT` operator.

```sql
(SELECT full_name FROM people WHERE age > 20)
INTERSECT
(SELECT full_name FROM people WHERE age < 25)
```


## Except Operator
Finding the set difference of two relations can be found by using the 
`EXCEPT` operator.

```sql
(SELECT full_name FROM people WHERE age > 20)
EXCEPT
(SELECT full_name FROM people WHERE age > 25)
```
