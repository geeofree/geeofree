## Data Models
A collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, 
data semantics, and consistency constraints.

### Relational Model
A data model that consist of tables and the relationships of each table. 
Where each table consists of one of more *attributes* or *columns* and 
where each row is an instance or a record.

### Entity-Relationship (ER) Model
A data model that consists of objects called *entities* and how each entity 
are related to one another.

### Semi-Structured Data Model
A data model that consists of attributes that may differ from record to record
(unlike in a relational model where each record must have the same attributes).

## Data Abstraction
The concept of hiding complexity through layering abstractions over one 
another. In a DBMS there are three layers of abstraction to take note of:

- **Physical Layer** describes how data is stored in the physical world.
- **Logical Layer** describes what data is stored and how they are related.
- **View Layer** describes what data is available.

## Database Instance
The information of a database at a given point.

## Database Schema
The overall design of a database.
