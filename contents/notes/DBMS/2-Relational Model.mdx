# 2.1 Structure of Relational Databases

## Structure of Relational Databases
A relational databases consists of a table or relation, where each relation 
consists of attributes or columns, and where each column consists of domains 
or a set of permitted values.

# 2.2 Database Schema

## Database Schema
Is a logical design of the database.

# 2.3 Keys

## Keys
Is an attribute or a set of attributes that uniquely identify tuples in a relation.

## Superkey
An attribute or a set of attributes that uniquely identify a tuple in a relation. 
A superkey can consist of other attributes.

## Candidate Key
Is a subset of a superkey that contains no unnecessary attributes.

## Primary Key
Is a candidate key selected by a Database Designer to uniquely identity tuples in 
a relation.

## Foreign Key
Is a key that references a primary key from another relation.

# 2.4 Schema Diagrams

## Schema Diagrams
Are pictorial representations of relations, its attributes, and with its relationships 
to other relations.

# 2.5 Relational Query Languages

## Query Language
Is a language that allows users to request information from a database.

## Imperative Query Languages
Are query languages that specify how data should be provided in an instructional 
manner.

## Functional Query Languages
Are query languages that specify how data should be provided through evaluations 
of function expressions.

## Declarative Query Languages
Are query languages that specify how data should be provided without specifying 
the sequence of operations to get that data.

# 2.6 Relational Algebra

## Select Operation
Returns a relation based from a given predicate.

$$\sigma_{predicate}(Relation)$$

## Project Operation
Returns a relation with the specified attributes.

$$\Pi_{attributes}(Relation)$$

## Composition of Relational Operators
Is the concept in which relational operators can be composed by providing a result 
relation as the input of another relational operator.

## Cartesian Product
Returns a relation that is a combination of tuples from two relations.

$$R \times S$$

## Join
Returns a relation that contains similar rows from two relations.

$$R \Join_{predicate} S$$

## Set Operations
Other than the operators discussed above, set operations can also be used to operate 
on relational sets. Specifically

- **Union** returns records that are in one relation or the other relation.
- **Intersection** returns records that are common in both relations.
- **Set Difference** returns records that are unique in one relation and none on the other.

## Assignment Operator
Puts results of a relation in a temporary variable.

$$some\_relation\_variable\_name \leftarrow Relation$$

## Rename Operator
Provides a name to a relation.

$$\rho_x(Relation)$$

Where *x* is the name of the resulting relation.
