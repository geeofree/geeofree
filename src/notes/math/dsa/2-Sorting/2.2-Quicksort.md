## Quicksort

Quicksort is an in-place sorting algorithm with a best-case runtime 
performance of $\Theta(n log n)$ and a worst-case runtime performance 
of $\Theta(n^2)$.

Despite having a worst-case runtime of $\Theta(n^2)$, Quicksort is favorable 
when it comes to sorting on average.

In other cases ie. when worst-case performance is more important than 
average performance, then heapsort may be much better in this case as it 
has a worst-case runtime of only $O(n log n)$.

### The Algorithm

The quicksort algorithm works by using a divide-and-conquer technique:

1. **Divide**: Recursively create two (2) *partitions* of the array using 
   a *pivot*.
2. **Conquer**: For each recursive iteration: one partition must have all 
   items $\leq$ the _pivot_ and the other partition must have all items $>$ the _pivot_.
3. **Merge**: There is no merge step as each partition step assures that the 
   array is sorted in place.

```py
def quicksort(A, p, r):
  if p < r:
    q = partition(A, p, r)
    quicksort(A, p, q - 1)
    quicksort(A, q + 1, r)
```

The `partition` procedure is the important part of the quicksort algorithm: it 
creates two (2) partitions such that all items in one partition is less than or 
equal to the pivot and the other is where all items are greater than the pivot.

This is done by iterating over items in the array at the range $p$ and $r$ where 
$A[r]$ is the _pivot_.

```py
def partition(A, p, r):
  pivot := A[r]
  i := p - 1
  
  while j := p < r:
    if A[j] <= pivot:
      i := i + 1
      swap(A[i], A[j])
    j := j + 1

  swap(A[i + 1], A[r])
  
  return i + 1
```

The loop-invariant condition of the partition are as follows:

For some index $k$ in array $A$:

1. **Left partition**: If $p \leq k \leq i$, then $A[k] \leq \text{pivot}$.
2. **Right partition**: If $i + 1 \leq k \leq r - 1$, then $A[k] > \text{pivot}$.
3. **Pivot**: If $k = r$, then $A[k] = \text{pivot}$.

The ff. figure is a visual image demonstration of how the partition procedure works:

- **(a)** The initial state: $4$ is designated as the pivot.
- **(b)** No swap is made since $6 > 4$ which also puts $6$ as part of the *right* partition.
- **(c)** $1$ and $6$ are swapped as $1 \leq 4$, this puts $1$ as part of the *left* partition.
- **(d)** No swap is made since $5 > 4$, making $5$ a part of the right partition.
- **(e)** $3$ and $6$ are swapped since $3 \leq 4$, $3$ is then added to the left partition.
- **(f)** $2$ and $5$ are swapped since $2 \leq 4$, $2$ is then added to the left partition.
- **(g)** The pivot is swapped with the first item in the right partition, putting it 
  in its final position such that $\text{left partition} \leq \text{pivot} < \text{right partition}$.
