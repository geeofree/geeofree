## Hash Table

A [hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table), hash map, or dictionary is a data structure where values (called a _bucket_ 
or a _slot_) are indexed using a _hash code_ that are generated from a hashing function 
for a given key.

### Collissions

Ideally, the hash function should be a one-to-one correspondence for the domain of keys 
to the range of buckets _however_ as the [pigeonhole principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle) shows there should be a 
collision at some point if there are more keys than there are buckets to uniquely assign 
it to.

### Techniques

#### Direct-Address Tables

Direct addressing is a simple technique if the amount of keys is reasonably small such 
that it is lesser than (or equal to) the number of slots within the direct-address table.
