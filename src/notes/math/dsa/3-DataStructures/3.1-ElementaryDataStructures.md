## Stacks & Queues

Stacks and queues are dynamic sets in which element removals are 
pre-specified.

Elements removed in a stack are always removed from the very last 
entry: **last-in, first-out (LIFO)**.

Elements on queues on the other are always removed from the very first 
entry: **first-in, first-out (FIFO)**.

### Stack

A stack $S$ contains a $top$ property that points to the most recent entry 
in the structure.

It also has the ff. procedures:

1. $\text{push}$ - adds an entry onto the end of the stack.
2. $\text{pop}$ - removes the latest entry from the stack.
3. $\text{stack\_empty}$ - checks if the stack is empty.

```py
def stack_empty(S):
  if S.top == 0:
    return True
  else
    return False


def push(S, x):
  S.top = S.top + 1
  S[S.top] = x
  
  
def pop(S):
  if stack_empty(S):
    error("underflow")
  else:
    S.top = S.top - 1
    return S[S.top + 1]
```

### Queues

A queue contains a $head$ and a $tail$ property that represents the first and last 
entries in the structure.

An $enqueue$ operation appends elements from the tail of the queue while a *dequeue* 
removes the entry in the $head$ (and makes the next entry from it the new $head$).

Here are some other properties that a queue has:

- If the $head$ and $tail$ properties are both equal to zero this means that the queue 
is empty.
- If the $head$ or $tail$ properties exceed the length of the list then they overflow or 
wrap around the structure.

```py
def enqueue(Q, x):
  Q[Q.tail] = x
  
  if Q.tail == Q.length:
    Q.tail = 1
  else:
    Q.tail = Q.tail + 1
    
    
def dequeue(Q):
  x = Q[Q.head]
  
  if Q.head == Q.length:
    Q.head = 1
  else:
    Q.head = Q.head + 1
    
  return x
```

## Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure where entries/nodes refer to one after 
another.

A _singly-linked list_ contains a $next$ property which holds a pointer to the 
next entry on the list and may also contain arbitrary satellite data.

A _doubly-linked_ contains an additional $previous$ property that points to the 
previous (it's predecessor) entry in the list.

Entries on the list can also have _empty_ or $NULL$ values for the $next$ or $previous$ 
properties which denote that an entry does not have a successor (it's the tail end) 
or a predecessor (it's the head).
