## The Cloud vs. On-Premise IT

Before Cloud services such as AWS were available, IT infrastructure was 
managed on-premise.

This means that IT resources such as servers, desktops, laptops, software, and 
networking were managed and maintained by on-premise IT experts.

There are drawbacks to this traditional model however, such as:

* Resources being expensive and not being used to full capacity.
* Hard to scale as resources would have to physically increase ie. 
  increasing servers might need extra space for the additional servers to 
  be placed into.
* Security of machine and software resources are maintained both by on-premise 
  IT experts.

With the Cloud however, these issues are solved by having:

* Resources that are only paid as they are used.
* IT components are managed on a higher or virtual level, making scaling easier.
* Security is managed with a [shared responsibility](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) model: Cloud providers such as AWS 
  handles the security *of* the Cloud while the customer manages the security of the 
  resources they use *in* the Cloud.

## AWS Cloud Roles

There are four (4) common Cloud Roles available in AWS, namely:

### Solutions Architect

The Cloud Subject Matter Expert (SME). Oversees the design of the business' Cloud 
environment.

### System Operations (SysOps)

Handles the networking, configuration, and maintenance of the business' Cloud network.

### Developer Operations (DevOps)

Oversees the process of development; handles the development pipeline by automating 
the process from code to testing to deployment.

### Security Administrator
