## Sorting Algorithms

For a given list of entries $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, ..., a_{n}$, a sorting algorithm 
permutates these entries such that it is sorted in:

- Ascending order: $a^{'}_1 \leq a^{'}_2 \leq a^{'}_3 \leq ... \leq a^{'}_n$
- Descending order: $a^{'}_1 \geq a^{'}_2 \geq a^{'}_3 \geq ... \geq a^{'}_n$

In general, sorting algorithms sort records of entries that contain a *[sorting] key* 
which is the value of a property to be sorted and may contain *satellite data* 
which are the remaining properties within the structure of an entry in the 
record.

For example, if there is a list of records that contain a person's information 
using the following structure:

```c
struct {
  char *name;
  char *address;
  unsigned int age;
} typedef Person;

Person[10] persons = { ... };
```

If we wanted to sort this list of persons by `age` in ascending order we designate
the sorting key to be the `age` property, while the remaining properties (`name` and 
`address`) are the satellite data.
