## Heaps & Heapsort

### Heap

A **heap** is a binary-tree data structure whose elements/nodes are stored in an array.

The size of the heap is the number of elements within the heap structure and will 
always be less than or equal to the array's length size.

More formally:

$$
0 \leq A.heap\_size \leq A.length\_size
$$

![Figure 1: Heap Structure](/images/figures/dsa/heaps.png)

The ff. procedures are used to index elements (in zero-based indexing) of a 
heap structure:

```py
def get_parent_index(i):
  return ceil(i / 2) - 1
  
def get_left_index(i):
  return (2 * i) + 1
  
def get_right_index(i):
  return (2 * i) + 2
```

Using the heap structure from the previous figure:

```py
parent_index = get_parent_index(1) # returns index 0
left_index = get_left_index(1)     # returns index 3
right_index = get_right_index(1)   # returns index 4

A[parent_index] # returns 27
A[left_index]   # returns 15
A[right_index]  # returns 13
```

### Max & Min Heaps

There are two kinds of heaps, namely:

1. **Max-Heaps** are heaps where parent nodes are always greater than or equal to 
   any of its child nodes.
   
   More formally:
   
   For an array $A$, a max-heap always has $A[parent\_index(i)] \geq A[i]$

2. **Min-Heaps** are the opposite of max-heaps in that the parent nodes are always 
   smaller than or equal any of its child nodes.
   
   More formally:
   
   For an array $A$, a min-heap always has $A[parent\_index(i)] \leq A[i]$

> For this chapter max-heap is used for demonstration, however  the same 
> method should work with min-heaps only in reverse.

### Maintaining the max-heap property

For some given index $i$, a max-heap structure must always have the property 
where:

$$
A[parent\_index(i)] \geq A[i]
$$

To maintain this structure we can:

1. Check which child nodes is the largest of the two for some given index $i$.
2. Swap the largest child node with the parent node.
3. Repeat steps $1$ to $2$, setting index $i$ for the index of the largest child 
   node, repeating until there are no child nodes that are larger than its parent 
   node or if the current index is a leaf node.

```py
def max_heapify(A, i):
  li = get_left_index(i)
  ri = get_right_index(i)
  
  largest_index = i
  
  if li <= A.heap_size and A[largest_index] < A[li]:
    largest_index = li

  if ri <= A.heap_size and A[largest_index] < A[ri]:
    largest_index = ri

  if largest_index != i
    swap(A[i], A[largest_index])
    max_heapify(A, largest_index)
```

### Building the max-heap

Once we have a procedure to *maintain* the max-heap structure we now need a procedure 
to turn an array into a max-heap structure.

To do this we iteratively use the `max_heapify()` procedure from the index of the last 
parent node to the root node of the heap structure.

The index of the last parent node in the tree can be retrieved by using the `get_parent_index()` 
procedure with the last index of the array:

```py
last_subroot_index := get_parent_index(A.length - 1)
```

```py
def build_max_heap(A):
  for i := get_parent_index(A.length - 1) to 0:
    max_heapify(A, i)
```

### Heapsort

The heapsort algorithm sorts a max-heap structure by:

1. Swapping the root node with the last node.
2. Decrementing the heap size by $1$.
3. Fixing the heap structure by calling `max_heapify(A, 0)`
4. Repeat steps $1$ to $3$ until the last parent node is processed.

```py
def heapsort(A):
  # Make the array into a heap structure
  build_max_heap(A)
  for i := A.length - 1 to 1:
    # Swap the root node with the last node
    swap(A[0], A[i])
    
    # Reduce the heap_size so the sorting procedure
    # doesn't swap it against unvisited nodes; the last 
    # swapped item stays in its final position
    A.heap_size = A.heap_size - 1
    
    # Run the `max_heapify` procedure, fixing the tree from
    # the root node downwards until `heap_size` exclusive.
    max_heapify(A, 0)
```
