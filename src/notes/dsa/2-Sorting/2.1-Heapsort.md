## Heaps & Heapsort

### Heap

A **heap** is a binary-tree data structure whose elements/nodes are stored in an array.

The size of the heap is the number of elements within the heap structure and will 
always be less than or equal to the array's length size.

More formally:

$$
0 \leq A.heap\_size \leq A.length\_size
$$

![Figure 1: Heap Structure](/images/figures/dsa/heaps.png)

The ff. procedures are used to index elements (in zero-based indexing) of a 
heap structure:

```py
def get_parent_index(i):
  return ceil(i / 2) - 1
  
def get_left_index(i):
  return (2 * i) + 1
  
def get_right_index(i):
  return (2 * i) + 2
```

Using the heap structure from the previous figure:

```py
parent_index = get_parent_index(1) # returns index 0
left_index = get_left_index(1)     # returns index 3
right_index = get_right_index(1)   # returns index 4

A[parent_index] # returns 27
A[left_index]   # returns 15
A[right_index]  # returns 13
```

### Max & Min Heaps

There are two kinds of heaps, namely:

1. **Max-Heaps** are heaps where parent nodes are always greater than or equal to 
   any of its child nodes.
   
   More formally:
   
   For an array $A$, a max-heap always has $A[parent\_index(i)] \geq A[i]$

2. **Min-Heaps** are the opposite of max-heaps in that the parent nodes are always 
   smaller than or equal any of its child nodes.
   
   More formally:
   
   For an array $A$, a min-heap always has $A[parent\_index(i)] \leq A[i]$

> For this chapter max-heap is used for demonstration, however  the same 
> method should work with min-heaps only in reverse.

### Maintaining the max-heap property

In order to maintain the max-heap property where $A[parent\_index(i)] \geq A[i]$, 
we must have a procedure that exactly does this, like so:

```py
def max_heapify(A, i):
  li = left_index(i)
  ri = right_index(i)
  
  largest_index = i
  
  if li < A.heap_size and A[largest_index] < A[li]:
    largest_index = li

  if ri < A.heap_size and A[largest_index] < A[ri]:
    largest_index = ri

  if largest_index != i
    swap(A[i], A[largest_index])
    max_heapify(A, largest_index)
```

This `max_heapify` procedure maintains the max-heap property by swapping parent 
nodes with the largest of its child node, recursively descending the tree until 
it encounters a leaf node.

### Building the max-heap

A property of heaps is that $A[(\lfloor{n/2}\rfloor) ... n]$ are all leaves of 
the tree where $n = A.heap\_size$.

Consequently with this property we can determine that $A[0] ... A[\lfloor{n/2}\rfloor - 1]$ 
will either be a root or subroot node which can allow us to build the max-heap 
tree:

```py
def build_max_heap(A):
  for i := floor(A.length / 2) to 0:
    max_heapify(A, i)
```

The `build_max_heap` procedure iteratively calls the `max_heapify` procedure from 
the last subroot up to the root node.

### Heapsort

The heapsort algorithm sorts a max-heap structure by:

1. Swapping the root node with the last node.
2. Fixing the heap structure by calling $max\_heapify(A, 0)$ to swap elements 
   from the root up to, but not including, the current $heap\_size$.
3. Decrementing the heap size by $1$.
4. Repeat step $1$ to $3$ until the last subroot is processed.

```py
def heapsort(A):
  build_max_heap(A)
  for i := A.length - 1 to 1:
    # Swap the root node to the last node
    swap(A[1], A[i])
    
    # Run the `max_heapify` procedure, fixing the tree from
    # the root node downwards until `heap_size` exclusive.
    max_heapify(A, 0)
    
    # Reduce the heap_size so the sorting procedure
    # doesn't swap it against unvisited nodes; it stays
    # in its final position
    A.heap_size = A.heap_size - 1
```
