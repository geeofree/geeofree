## Stacks & Queues

Stacks and queues are dynamic sets in which element removals are 
pre-specified.

Elements removed in a stack are always removed from the very last 
entry: **last-in, first-out (LIFO)**.

Elements on queues on the other are always removed from the very first 
entry: **first-in, first-out (FIFO)**.

### Stack

A stack $S$ contains a $top$ property that points to the most recent entry 
in the structure.

It also has the ff. procedures:

1. $\text{push}$ - adds an entry onto the end of the stack.
2. $\text{pop}$ - removes the latest entry from the stack.
3. $\text{stack\_empty}$ - checks if the stack is empty.

```py
def stack_empty(S):
  if S.top == 0:
    return True
  else
    return False


def push(S, x):
  S.top = S.top + 1
  S[S.top] = x
  
  
def pop(S):
  if stack_empty(S):
    error("underflow")
  else:
    S.top = S.top - 1
    return S[S.top + 1]
```

### Queues

A queue contains a $head$ and a $tail$ property that represents the first and last 
entries in the structure.

It's $insert$ operation is called an $enqueue$ that adds entries after its $tail$ while 
it's $remove$ operation is called a $dequeue$ that removes the first entry in the $head$.

If the $head$ and $tail$ properties are both equal to zero this means that the queue 
is empty.

If the $tail$ or $head$ properties exceed the length of the list then they overflow or 
wrap around the structure.

```py
def enqueue(Q, x):
  Q[Q.tail] = x
  
  if Q.tail == Q.length:
    Q.tail = 1
  else:
    Q.tail = Q.tail + 1
    
    
def dequeue(Q):
  x = Q[Q.head]
  
  if Q.head == Q.length:
    Q.head = 1
  else:
    Q.head = Q.head + 1
    
  return x
```

## Linked Lists
