## Typing Spanish Accents & Characters

Wiki: [Combined Diacritical Marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_Diacritical_Marks)

For example:

- `ñ` = `n` + ` ̃ (U + 0303)`
- `á` = `a` + ` ́ (U + 0301)`
- `í` = `i` + ` ́ (U + 0301)`

Opening Question Mark: `¿ (U + 00BF)`

Opening Exclamation Mark: `¡ (U + 00A1)`

## Gendered Language

Spanish uses *gendered language* to describe most things.

This means that adjectives, pronouns, articles, etc. are based on the 
nouns that they describe.

In most cases, nouns that end with **-o** are considered *masculine* while 
nouns that end in **-i** are considered *feminine*.

There are exceptions to this rule of course and should be learned.
