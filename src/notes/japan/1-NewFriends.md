# XはYです

"...です" is a japanese linking verb that roughly means "to be" and is used for polite 
speaking.

For example:

がくせいです

(I) am a student

ジユです

I am Geo. 

フィリピンじんです

I am a Filipino.

Note that the subjects are not necessarily needed if its already estabilished what is 
being talked about.

If the subject IS explicitly needed to be discussed then the "は" (pronounced as "wa") 
_topic particle_ is to be used.

For example:

わたし(は)がくせいです.

I am a student.

わたし(は)ギユです.

I am Geo.

いま(は)にじです.

It is 2 o' clock right now.

# Question Sentences
To ask a question, add か to the end of the sentence.

なまえですか

(What's your) name?

がくせいですか

(Are you a) student?

Question sentences may also contain a "question word" like なん.

Example of question words are: なんじ (what time), なんさい(how old), 
なんねんせい (what year in school), and なんばん (what number).

For example:

いまはなんじですか

What time is it now?

ジユさんはなんさいですか

How old are you, Geo?

> なん is used before ...です or a _counter_ like じ (o'clock).
> 
> なに is used before a particle.

# XのY
The の particle connects two nouns where the first noun restricts or provides specific 
context to the second noun which is the "main idea" of the phrase.

For example:

せんせい の ジユ です.

Geo's professor.

フィリピンじん の がくせい です.

A Filipino student.
