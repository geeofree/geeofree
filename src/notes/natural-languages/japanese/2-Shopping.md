# Referring to unspecific things: これ, それ, あれ, どれ
これ is used for referring to things that are close to the speaker ie. 
_this thing right here_.

これ は わたし の ペーン です (This is my pen).

それ is used for referring to things that are close to the person that the speaker is 
talking to ie. _that thing next to them_.

それ は わたし の ペーン です (That is my pen).

あれ is used for referring to things that are far away from both the speaker and their 
listener ie. _that thing over there_.

あれ は わたし の ペーン です (That over there is my pen).

どれ is used to ask _which_.

どれですか (Which is it?)

> This should never be used to refer to people.
> Only use this to refer to (unspecific) things.

# Referring to specific things: この,その,あの,どの + Noun
These set of pronouns refer to specific things (unlike the previous section which refers 
to unspecific things).

この + Noun = This <thing>

この ほん は いくら ですか (How much is this book?)

その + Noun = That <thing>

その ほん は いくら ですか (How much is that book?)

あの + Noun = That <thing> over there

あの ほん は いくら ですか (How much is that book over there?)

どの + Noun = Which <thing>

どの ほん が にほんご ですか (Which book is japanese?)

> Question words like どれ and なに cannot be followed by the particle は and must use 
> が instead ie. なに が すき (What do you like?)

# Referring to a point in place: ここ, そこ, あそこ, どこ

ここ (here, near me)

そこ (there, near you)

あそこ (over there)

どこ (where)

# だれ and だれの + Noun
だれ means _who_ and だれの means _whose <thing>_.

# Noun + も
In order to refer that something else is also true use the も particle after a noun.

ジユさん も がくせい です (Geo is a student too; Geo is a student also)

# Negating a statement: じゃないです
To negate a statement of the form _X は Y です_, where _Y_ is a noun. Replace です with 
じゃないです.

やまださん は がくせい じゃないです (Mr. Yamada is not a student)

じゃないです is very casual. A more formal expression for ないです is ありません and 
an even more formal expression is to used the uncontracted version of じゃ which 
is では (_dewa_).

やまださん は がくせい じゃありません (Formal)

やまださん は がくせい ではありません (More formal)

# ~ね/~よ
To seek the listener's confirmation end the statement with ね which is the same expression 
as asking _right?_ in english.

よしださん は がくせい です ね (Mr. Yoshida is a student, right?)

これ は にく じゃないです ね (This is not meat, right?)

In order to express to the listener that you are fully confident about your statement end 
it with よ.

とんかつ は さかな じゃないです よ (I assure you that this "tonkatsu" is not fish).

# Other Items

In order to request items in general use the expression 
(を)ください (Please give me <thing>).

(を) おねがいします too is used for requesting things but in a formal expression.
