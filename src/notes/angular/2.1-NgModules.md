## NgModules

**NgModules** provides a compilation context for components, directives, 
or pipes and helps organize these entities into a cohesive environment.

A class can be defined as an **NgModule** using the `@NgModule` decorator 
which contains the ff. metadata:

| Property       | Description                                                                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `declarations` | The component, directive, or pipe that belongs to a module.                         |
| `imports`      | Other modules that are being used.                                                  |
| `exports`      | Entities that are exposed by this module that other modules can use when importing. |
| `providers`    | Services that the module uses.                                                      |
| `bootstrap`    | The initial component(s) that other components connect to.                          |

The **declarables** (components, directives, and pipes) defined in the 
`declarations` array must be defined exactly once per module.

## Feature Modules

**Feature modules** are modules that work in a certain domain or business logic.

The ff. are some categories of **feature modules** that can be done:

| Category  | Description                                                                       |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Domain*  | Is organized around a feature, business domain, or user experience.               |
| *Routed*  | The top component of an NgModule. Acts as the destination of a router navigation. |
| *Routing* | Provides the routing configuration for another module.                            |
| *Service* | Provides utility services such as data access or messaging.                       |
| *Widget*  | A declarable available to other modules.                                          |
| *Shared*  | A set of declarables available to other modules.                                  |

## Service Providers

Service providers defines some business logic within an Angular application.

A class can be defined as a service provider using the `@Injectable` decorator 
which contains the optional `providedIn` metadata property.

The `providedIn` property describes the _scope_ that a service provider can 
be available in.

If `providedIn` is set as `'root'` then the service provider is available as 
a single class to all modules in the application.

A service provider can also be scoped specifically to a module `providedIn: <Module>` 
setting:

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'
import { SomeModule } from './path/to/some.module'

@Injectable({
  providedIn: SomeModule
})
export class SomeService {}
```

This can also be done by declaring the service in the `providers` 
array in a module:

```ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'
import { SomeService } from './path/to/some.service'

@NgModule({
  providers: [SomeService]
})
export class SomeModule {}
```

## Lazy Loading Modules

Modules can be lazy loaded by a router in an Angular application 
using the `loadChild` route property.

Lazy loaded modules will use the local instance of a service with 
the same name ie. if `SomeService` is defined at the root level and 
a lazy loaded module also defines it in its own context, then the 
lazy loaded module will use its own local `SomeService` instance.
