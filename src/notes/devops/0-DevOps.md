## DevOps

Is a software development process that promotes development velocity and constant refactoring 
by combining and automating software development and IT operations processes to build high 
quality products.

The DevOps development process works as follows:

#### Development

1. *Planning* - Describes the objectives, ideas, user stories, features, or tasks to be implemented.
2. *Coding* - The software implementation of an objective.
3. *Testing* - Manual and/or automated tests of the application code.

#### Integration

4. *Releasing* - The process of preparing the application code for deployment once all 
tests have passed.

#### Operations

5. *Deployment* - Deploys the application code to the live environment.
6. *Monitoring* - Management and inspection of the newly deployed application code in the 
live environment.
8. *Feedback* - Describes faults or defects of the new implementation that will then be 
reported back into the planning stage.

## Continuous Integration And Deployment (CI/CD)

Is a *pipeline* of automated set of processes that can execute testing, building, 
and deployment when new code changes are submitted.

## Infrastructure As A Code (IAAC)

Tools that automate infrastructure processes such as provisioning, software installment, 
configuration, and deployment.

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) are two popular tools for IAAC.
