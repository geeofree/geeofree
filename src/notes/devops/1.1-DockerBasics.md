## Docker

Software that manages isolated lightweight virtual environments 
called *containers* that can hosts programs or applications.

Unlike a Virtual Machine that runs programs within a *Guest OS* that 
requires constant provisioning and configuration, *Docker* uses 
the same *Host OS* run programs and also takes care of provisioning 
and configuration of an environment using an executable environment 
called *images*.

### Images

Are executable *isolated virtual environments* that contains the filesystem, 
configuration, and packages or binaries that exists within that environment.

### Containers

Are sandboxed processes; instances of docker *images*.
