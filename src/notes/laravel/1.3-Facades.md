## Facades

A [facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) is a design pattern that provides a much simpler interface to 
an otherwise complex implementation that uses many different classes:

```php
<?php

class Foo {
  // ...
}

class Bar {
  // ...
}

class Baz {
  // ...
}

class Facade {
  function doSomething()
  {
    $foo = new Foo;
    $bar = new Bar;
    $baz = new Baz;
    
    $a = $foo->thing();
    $b = $bar->another($a);
    $c = $baz->last($a, $b);
    
    return $c;
  }
}
```

In Laravel, facades are used as _static proxy calls_ to methods of services.

Most facades in Laravel are available under `Illuminate\Support\Facades`

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache

Route::get('/thing', function() {
  return Cache::get('thing');
});
```

Here, the `Route` and `Cache` facades call the `get` method on the router and 
cache services respectively.

Most facades are also available as _helper functions_, for example when
using the router service the `route` helper function can be used instead 
of `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route`.
