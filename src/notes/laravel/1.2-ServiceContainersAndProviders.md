## Service Containers

Is a class that manages services and its dependencies in Laravel.

By default, Laravel automatically injects dependencies as long as these 
are concrete classes and do not have dependencies themselves.

```php
<?php

class MyClass {
  someMethod(OtherClass $otherClass) {
    $otherClass->doThing();
  }
}
```

Here, the `OtherClass` class did not have to be instantiated but is instead 
_injected_ as the `MyClass->someMethod`'s argument; the `OtherClass` 
did not have to be manually constructed to be used.

This makes the service container the _single source of truth_ for every 
dependency that is going to be used in a Laravel application.

## Service Providers

Bootstraps application entities such as containers, event listeners, 
middleware, or routes.

A _Service Provider_ is a class that has a `register` and `boot` method.

To generate a service provider, run:

```bash
php artisan make:provider <ProviderName>
```

In order to use a service provider, they must defined in the `providers` 
array in the `config/app.php` file.

### Registering

The `register` method of a service provider class is responsible for 
binding services to the app service container.

This method contains a reference to the _app service container_ which 
has methods to bind different services to it:

#### Bind

The `bind` registers a service class to the app service container where 
the service class is instantiated each time it is injected:

```php
<?php
class BankAccount {
  private float $amount;
  
  function __construct(float $amount)
  {
    $this->amount = $amount;
  }
  
  function account_details()
  {
    return $this->amount;
  }
  
  function withdraw(float $amount)
  {
    $this->amount = $this->amount - $amount;
  }
  
  function deposit(float $amount)
  {
    $this->amount = $this->amount + $amount;
  }
}
```

```php
<?php

class MyServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider {
  function register()
  {
    $this->app->bind(BankAccount::class, function($app) {
      return new BankAccount(0.0);
    })
  }
}
```

```php
<?php

class Ranni {
  function payment(BankAccount $bankAccount)
  {
    $bankAccount->account_details(); // 0.0
    $bankAccount->deposit(1000);
    $bankAccount->withdraw(250);
    $bankAccount->account_details(); // 750.0
  }
}

class Mohg {
  function payment(BankAccount $bankAccount)
  {
    $bankAccount->account_details(); // 0.0
    $bankAccount->deposit(1000);
    $bankAccount->withdraw(250);
    $bankAccount->account_details(); // 750.0
  }
}
```

#### Singleton

The `singleton` method binds the service class to the app service container 
but will provide the same instance to every class that depends on this 
service class:

```php
<?php

class MyServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider {
  function register()
  {
    $this->app->singleton(BankAccount::class, function($app) {
      return new BankAccount(0.0);
    })
  }
}
```

```php
<?php

class Ranni {
  function payment(BankAccount $bankAccount)
  {
    $bankAccount->account_details(); // 0.0
    $bankAccount->deposit(1000);
    $bankAccount->withdraw(250);
    $bankAccount->account_details(); // 750.0
  }
}

class Mohg {
  function payment(BankAccount $bankAccount)
  {
    $bankAccount->account_details(); // 750.0
    $bankAccount->deposit(1000);
    $bankAccount->withdraw(250);
    $bankAccount->account_details(); // 1500.0
  }
}
```

#### Instance

An instance of a service class can also be bound to the app service container 
using the `instance` method. This will return the same instance on each use:

```php
<?php

class MyServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider {
  function register()
  {
    $bankAccount = new BankAccount(100);
    $this->app->bind(BankAccount::class, $bankAccount);
  }
}
```

### Booting

The `boot` method of a service provider runs after all service providers have 
been registered.

This allows for other services to be available and can be used, for example,
to bind another service class in the app service container that depends on 
a registered service class:

```php
<?php

class MyServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider {
  function boot(BankAccount $bankAccount)
  {
    $this->app->bind(OtherService::class, function($app) {
      return new OtherService($bankAccount);
    })
  }
}
```

### Deferring Providers

Providers may also be lazy loaded by implementing the `DeferrableProvider` 
interface which requires a `provides` method that returns a list of registered 
service container bindings.

```php
<?php

class MyServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider implements DeferrableProvider {
  function providers()
  {
    return [BankAccount::class, Foo::class, ...etc];
  }
}
```
