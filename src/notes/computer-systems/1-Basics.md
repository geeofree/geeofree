## Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

Defines the set of instructions and data that a computer 
can perform onto.

* **Opcode** is a symbol that can operate on data ie. add, subtract, move.
* **Operand** is data that can be operated on.
* **Data Type** the representation of a data ie. integer, float, etc.
* **Addressing Mode** identifies operands in a computer.

There are also two classifications of instruction sets, namely:

#### Complex Instruction Set Computer (RISC)

An instruction set that performs multiple operations for a single 
instruction, reducing the number of opcodes.

#### Reduce Instruction Set Computer (RISC)

An instruction set that performs a single operation for a single 
instruction, increasing the number of opcodes.

## Microarchitecture

Defines how an ISA is to be implemented physically; the circuit 
design of an ISA.

## Microprocessor

The physical implementation of a Microarchitecture.
