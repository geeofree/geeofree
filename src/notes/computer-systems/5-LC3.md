## The ISA: Overview

The ISA describes all the information needed for software to communicate 
with or instruct the underlying hardware of the computer system.

It also specifies the memory organization, register set, and instruction set, 
including opcodes, data types, and addressing modes in the instruction.

### Memory Organization

The memory organization describes the computer memory's address size and space.

For the LC-3 has an address space of $2^{16} = 65,536$ locations and an address 
size of 16 bits, making it's total memory capacity equal to exactly $1,048,576$ 
bits (or roughly $131\text{KB}$).

The unit of data (a _word_) that the LC-3 can process is the same as it's address 
size ($16$ bits), meaning it is [word-addressable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_addressing).

> There is also [byte-addressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_addressing) which most computer systems use.

### Register Set

Registers are a storage unit that's colocated near the CPU to make it faster to 
access temporary data when working on operations.

In most cases it makes it so that temporary data can be accessed at a single clock 
cycle instead of at least two when accessing data from the memory.

The LC-3 has $8$ registers, each of which can store one word ($16$ bits) and are 
uniquely identified by a $3$-bit register number.

### The Instruction Set

An instruction is made up of two components: the *opcode* and the *operand*.

The instruction set is described by its opcodes, data types, and addressing mode 
of the ISA.

- The **opcode** defines the operators that can be performed.
- The **data type** describes what the data is represented as (ie. a 2's complement 
  integer, a floating number, or ASCII).
- The **addressing mode** describes where the data/operand is located (ie. on the 
  registers, in memory, or within the instruction itself).

The LC-3 has $15$ usable instructions, each identified by its unique opcode (found 
in bits [$15$:$12$]):

### Addressing Modes

The addressing mode defines where the data/operand is accessed or located.

Generally an operand can be found within the registers, in memory, or within the 
instruction itself (this is called a *literal* or *immediate* operand).

The LC-3 supports five addressing modes: _literal_, _register_, and three memory addressing 
modes: _PC-relative_, _indirect_, and _base + offset_.

### Condition Codes

Condition codes (or status codes) are single-bit registers that denote a condition 
(or some status) when an operation occurs.

In the case of the LC-3 there is the $N$, $Z$, and $P$ condition codes that represent _negative_, 
_zero_, and _positive_ results respectively.

These are set whenever data is written onto a register, ie. if an add results in a 
negative value and is written onto the $8$ registers, then the $N$ status register is 
set to $1$ and the $Z$ and $P$ status registers are set to $0$.

This can be used for example to change the sequence of execution of the instructions in 
a computer program.
