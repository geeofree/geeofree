## Bits

Binary digits (or _bits_) are the primitive unit of information in a 
computer system.

A bit is essentially the _existence_ or _non-existence_ of a voltage 
in a computer; any voltage which is measured close to zero(0) means 
a non-existent signal while anything bigger than one(1) means the 
existence of a signal.

A **data type** provides the context on what a string of bits represent 
ie. an integer, character code, or floating point number.

### Representations

#### Integers

A data type that represents the number zero, positive, and negative 
whole numbers.

#### Unsigned Integers

Represents positive integers and zero only.

For some number of bits $k$, there can be $0$ to $2^k - 1$ unsigned 
integers to be represented.

For example, if there are three(3) bits, then it can represent 
the unsigned integers $0$ to $2^3 - 1  = 7$.

| Bit | Decimal |
|-----|---------|
| 000 | 0       |
| 001 | 1       |
| 010 | 2       |
| 011 | 3       |
| 100 | 4       |
| 101 | 5       |
| 110 | 6       |
| 111 | 7       |

#### Signed Integers

There are three main ways to represent signed integers, these are 
namely:

##### Signed Magnitude

Represents integers by reserving the left-most bit (also known as the 
sign bit) as an indicator of whether it is a positive or negative number. 

For a given positive non-zero integer $k$, there is a total of $2^{k-1}$
to represent the *magnitude* of numbers in this representation.

For example if $k = 3$, then there are $2^{3-1} = 2^2 = 4$ total 
numbers to represent the positive or negative integers.

| Bit | Decimal |
|-----|---------|
| 000 | 0       |
| 001 | 1       |
| 010 | 2       |
| 011 | 3       |
| 100 | -0      |
| 101 | -1      |
| 110 | -2      |
| 111 | -3      |

##### 1's Complement

Represents integers by complementing the bits: inverting the $0$ 
to a $1$ and vice versa.

This representation also uses a sign bit to indicate whether it is positive 
or negative.

For example, to get the 1's complement of the decimal number $3$, we first 
get its bit representation which is $3 = 011$, then complement the bits which 
would result in $100 = -3$.

| Bit | Decimal |
|-----|---------|
| 000 | 0       |
| 001 | 1       |
| 010 | 2       |
| 011 | 3       |
| 100 | -3      |
| 101 | -2      |
| 110 | -1      |
| 111 | -0      |

##### 2's Complement

Represents integers the same way as the **1's Complement** (ie. inverting the 
values), but has an extra step of adding a $1$ to the result.

In this representation, the sign bit represents $-2^{k-1}$.

For example to represent the decimal number $-2$ we first get its 
**1's Complement** which is $101$, then add $1$ which results in $110$:

$$
110 = -2^2 + 2^1 + 0^0 = -4 + 2 = -2
$$

| Bit | Decimal |
|-----|---------|
| 000 | 0       |
| 001 | 1       |
| 010 | 2       |
| 011 | 3       |
| 100 | -4      |
| 101 | -3      |
| 110 | -2      |
| 111 | -1      |

### Bit Integer Arithmetic

#### Addition

Given 4-bits, adding $5 + 4$ as unsigned integers results in:

$$
0101 + 0100 = 1001 = 9
$$

#### Subtraction

Given 4-bits, adding $6 - 3$ as signed integers results in:

$$
0110 - 1101 = 0011 = 3
$$

#### Bit Shifting

A property of binary arithmetic is that adding a number by itself 
shifts the bits to the left ie. $3 + 3 = 0011 + 0011 = 0110 = 6$, this is 
simply because the value is multipled by [a multiple of] $2$:

$$
3 + 3 = 2(3)
$$

$$
= 2[0(2^3) + 0(2^2) + 1(2^1) + 1(2^0) + 0(2^{-1})]
$$

$$
= 0(2^4) + 0(2^3) + 1(2^2) + 1(2^1) + 0(2^0)
$$

$$
= 00110
$$

$$
= 0110
$$

$$
= 6
$$

Corollary, dividing the bits by [a multiple of] $2$ shifts it to the right:

$$
6 = 0110
$$

$$
6 / 2 = 2^{-1}[0(2^3) + 2(2^2) + 2(2^1) + 0(2^0) + 0(2^-1)]
$$

$$
= 0(2^2) + 2(2^1) + 2(2^0) + 0(2^{-1}) + 0(2^{-2})
$$

$$
= 0011
$$

$$
= 3
$$

#### Sign Extension

Two bit strings with differing lengths can be processed by _extending_ the sign 
bit of the smaller length bit string.

For example, given the number $21$ as a 5-bit integer and the number $-3$ as 
a 3-bit integer:

1. Represent $21$ in binary: $21 = 01111$
2. Represent $-3$ in binary: $-3 = 101$
3. _Extend_ the sign-bit of $-3$ to 5-bits: $11101$
4. Now add: $01111 - 11101 = 01100 = 12$

#### Overflow/Underflow

Since computers work with a finite length of bits, there comes a situation where 
processing bits would result in an error such as an **overflow** or **underflow** 
of values.

An **overflow** result would be when, for example, adding two signed integers goes 
over the maximum magnitude.

For example on a 5-bit string which has a maximum positive integer of $2^4 - 1 = 15$, 
adding two positive integers would result in a negative integer, for example $15 + 1 = -16$.

An **underflow** is the same but results in a positive integer if two negatives are 
processed and go over the minimum negative integer.

### Bit Logical Operations

#### NOT (Complement)

Returns $0$ if the given value is $1$ and vice versa.

| A | NOT |
|---|-----|
| 0 | 1   |
| 1 | 0   |

#### AND

For two given bits $A$ and $B$, the $AND$ operator returns a $1$ iff. both $A$ and $B$ 
are $1$, $0$ otherwise.

| A | B | AND |
|---|---|-----|
| 0 | 0 | 0   |
| 0 | 1 | 0   |
| 1 | 0 | 0   |
| 1 | 1 | 1   |

**AND** is commonly used for **bit-masking**: the retrieval or extraction of specific 
information in a bit string.

For example, it can be used to determine if a 2's complement bit string
is odd:

```c
3 & 1 = 1; // Odd  => 011 & 001 = 001 = 1
2 & 1 = 0; // Even => 010 & 001 = 000 = 0
```

#### OR

For two given bits $A$ and $B$, the $OR$ operator returns a $1$ iff. either $A$ or $B$ 
are $1$, $0$ if both $A$ and $B$ are $0$ otherwise.

| A | B | OR |
|---|---|----|
| 0 | 0 | 0  |
| 0 | 1 | 1  |
| 1 | 0 | 1  |
| 1 | 1 | 1  |

#### XOR (Exclusive OR)

For two given bits $A$ and $B$, the $OR$ operator returns a $1$ iff. either $A$ or $B$ 
are $1$ but not both.

| A | B | XOR |
|---|---|-----|
| 0 | 0 | 0   |
| 0 | 1 | 1   |
| 1 | 0 | 1   |
| 1 | 1 | 0   |

**XOR** can be used to check if two bit strings are the same.

#### De Morgan's Law

States two properties of composed logical operators:

1. The complement of $NOT(A)\ AND\ NOT(B)$ is equivalent to $A\ OR\ B$.

$$
NOT(NOT(A)\ AND\ NOT(B)) = A\ OR\ B
$$

| A | B | NOT(A) | NOT(B) | NOT(A) AND NOT(B) | NOT(NOT(A) AND NOT(B)) | A OR B |
|---|---|--------|--------|-------------------|------------------------|--------|
| 0 | 0 | 1      | 1      | 1                 | 0                      | 0      |
| 0 | 1 | 1      | 0      | 0                 | 1                      | 1      |
| 1 | 0 | 0      | 1      | 0                 | 1                      | 1      |
| 1 | 1 | 0      | 0      | 0                 | 1                      | 1      |

2. The complement of $NOT(A)\ OR\ NOT(B)$ is equivalent to $A\ AND\ B$.

$$
NOT(NOT(B)\ OR\ NOT(A)) = A\ AND\ B
$$

| A | B | NOT(A) | NOT(B) | NOT(A) OR NOT(B) | NOT(NOT(A) OR NOT(B)) | A AND B |
|---|---|--------|--------|------------------|-----------------------|---------|
| 0 | 0 | 1      | 1      | 1                | 0                     | 0       |
| 0 | 1 | 1      | 0      | 1                | 0                     | 0       |
| 1 | 0 | 0      | 1      | 1                | 0                     | 0       |
| 1 | 1 | 0      | 0      | 0                | 1                     | 1       |

#### Floating Point

Is a form of [scientific notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation) that represents Real numbers in 
a finite set of bits.

The most widely adopted standard to represent floating point arithmetic 
is the [IEEE-754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) standard where in a 32-bit system:

* The left-most bit is the *sign bit*.
* The next 8 bits are the *exponent* which is calculated by subtracting the *excess*.
* And the remaining 23 bits are the *mantissa*.

![Floating Point Sections](/images/figures/computer-systems/floating-point-sections.png)

Notation:

$$
S \times 1.M \times 2^E
$$

Where:

* **S** is the sign bit.
* **M** is the mantissa.
* **E** is the exponent derived from some bit string that is subtracted to $127$ (the 
  *excess* number). For example, if the exponent is $4$, then the bit string to 
  represent this in floating point notation is $127 + 4 = 131 = 1000\ 0011$.

To convert a Real number to a floating point:

1. Convert the significands on the left and right sides of the *radix* (decimal point): 
   * The left-side is derived by continuously dividing the value by 2 and retrieving 
     the remainders.
   * The right-side is derived by continuously multiplying the value by 2 and retrieving 
     the value on the right hand side of the result. This should have repeating patterns.
2. Move the decimal point either left or right to get the *exponent*.
