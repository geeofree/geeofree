## The von Neumann Model

The [von Neumann model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture) is a computer model or architecture that is  
widely used in many modern computer systems.

The model describes five (5) components for a computer:

![The von Neumann Architecture Scheme](/images/figures/computer-systems/von-neumann-architecture-scheme.png)

### Memory

The component for storing instructions to be executed or data to be 
operated on.

The memory contains two (2) registers:

1. **Memory Address Register (MAR)** for indexing or locating an address 
   cell in the memory.
2. **Memory Data Register (MDR)** for either loading or writing data from/to 
   the indexed address cell by the MAR.

### Processing Unit

The component that operates on values that transform them into other values.

The simplest processing unit in the von Neumann model is called the [Arithemtic Logic Unit (ALU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit)
and can do arithmetic and boolean operations.

The ALU processes a fix sized bit unit called a [word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture)) whose length is dependent 
based on the design of the computer architecture.

ALUs are also accomodated with storage facilities called [registers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register) that are at 
close proximity to it and are used for temporary storage with submillisecond 
read/write speeds.

ALU registers are also uniquely identifiable and can be indexed ie. for $n$ bits 
there are $2^n$ uniquely identifiable registers.

### Input/Output

The input and output (or I/O) components are external devices or peripherals 
that allows the computer system to receive information and output it to 
something else.

An example of an input device could be a mouse or a keyboard.

For the output device it could be a monitor or a printer.

### Control Unit

This component manages which instruction is being executed or is going to 
be executed next by the processing unit.

The control unit contains two registers that does these things respectively 
and are the:

- **Instruction Register (IR)** stores the instruction currently being executed.
- **Program Counter (PC)** stores the address of the instruction that is going 
  to be executed next.

## Instruction Processing

*Instructions* are the basic unit of computer processing and is made up of 
two components: the **opcode** and the **operand**.

There are fundamentally three (3) types of instructions that can be done 
in a computer system:

### Operate

Instructions that transform data into a different value in a computer system.

Examples of operate instructions are `ADD`, `SUB`, and `AND`.

### Data Move

Instructions that move data in different storage facilities such as in a register 
or a memory unit.

An example of a data move instruction is the `LD` or load instruction.

### Control

Instructions that changes how instructions are to be executed by the processing unit.

For example instead of sequentially executing instructions it can 
execute instructions in an arbitrary order.

These instructions are the basic building blocks for loops and branching 
statements in high-level programming languages.

An example of a control instruction is the `BR` or branch instruction.

## The Instruction Cycle

Instructions are processed in a processing unit in a systematic manner.

Typically processing units have a six (6) phase instruction cycle where 
each phase could perform $0$ or more steps in it.

> Having $0$ steps means a phase is skipped for execution as an instruction 
> might not necessarily need it.

### FETCH

The **fetch** phase in the instruction cycle does three (3) things:

1. It first indexes the address cell in the memory unit by loading the value 
   stored in the program counter (PC) to the MAR then increments the PC.
2. The memory unit is then asked to load the contents of the indexed address 
   cell into the MDR.
3. The contents of the MDR are then loaded into the instruction register (IR) 
   of the control unit.

### DECODE

The **decode** phase determines which action is going to be done by the processing 
unit as instructed from the IR in the control unit ie. should it do an operate, 
data move, or control instruction.

### EVALUATE ADDRESS

The **evaluate address** phase computes the memory location that is needed 
by the instruction process.

For example the `LD` instruction requires indexing of an address cell on 
the memory unit for the data that is going to be moved.

It should be noted that not all instructions require this phase ie. for 
an operate instruction whose operands are in the ALU registers or within 
the instruction itself.

### FETCH OPERANDS

The **fetch operands** phase retrieves the source operands needed to process 
the instruction.

For example an `LD` instruction which fetches the data for its operand from 
the memory unit or an `ADD` instruction which fetches the data for its 
operands from the ALU registers or in its own instruction info.

### EXECUTE

The **execute** phase simply executes the given instruction.

### STORE RESULT

The **store result** final phase stores of the instruction into some storage 
facility such as the ALU registers or the memory unit.

## Trap Instructions

A **trap** (or [interrupt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt)) instruction is an instruction that halts (*interrupts*) 
a processor's current execution.

This is useful for processes that can be instructed to run indefinitely to be 
halted so it doesn't [starve other processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_(computer_science)).
