<h1>WHOAMI</h1>

<p>Hello. I am a Software Engineer from the Philippines.</p>

<p>I had my Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology back in May 2017.</p>

<p>
	My career started back in September 2017 and have honed 
	many different skills and held many different responsibilities 
	since then.
</p>

<p>I mostly do Web Development.</p>
