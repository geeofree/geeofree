# 3.1 Quantifiers

## Quantifier

Is a symbol or word that denotes the amount of items to be considered for a
given statement.

## Universal Quantifier

A quantifier that denotes that all elements must be true for a given statement.

## Existential Quantifier

A quantifier that denotes that at least one element must be true for a given
statement.

## Negation of Quantifiers

For some open sentence _P(x)_ where for some domain $x \in S$

- The negation of a _universal quantifier_ is the existential quantifier
  where the statement is false.

  $\lnot(\forall x \in S, P(x)) \equiv \exists x \in S, \lnot P(x)$

- The negation of an _existential quantifier_ is the universal quantifier
  where the statement is false.

  $\lnot(\exists x \in S, P(x)) \equiv \forall x \in S, \lnot P(x)$

# 3.2 Proofs

## Proof

A presentation of logical arguments that demonstrates the truth value of a given
statement.

## Direct Proof

A proof method in which, given an implication, the hypothesis is assumed to be true
that then derives that the conclusion has to be true as well.

## Proof by Contrapositive

Much like a direct proof, a proof by contrapositive assumes that the implication's
negated conclusion is true which then derives that the negated hypothesis must be
true as well.

## Proof of Biconditionals

Is a proof in which the given implication and its converse must both be shown to be
true.

## Proof by Cases

A proof method in which the problem domain is partitioned, where each partition is a
_case_ that can be used to prove the statement.

## Parity of Integers

An axiom in which two distinct integers _a_ and _b_ are said to be of same parity if
both _a_ and _b_ are even or both are odd, they are called _opposite parity_ otherwise.

## Without Loss Of Generality (wlog.)

Is a proof method that shows that a given statement is true by considering that only
one case suffices to prove that the statement is true.

## Counterexamples

Is a proof method that shows that a statement is false for at least one element in the
problem domain.

## Existential Proofs

Is a proof method that shows that a statement is true for at least one element in the
problem domain.

## Proof by Contradiction

Is a proof method that shows that when a statement is false leads to a contradiction.
