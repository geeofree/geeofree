# 1.1 Graphs

## Graphs
A graph *G* is a set of vertices *V* and a set of edges *E*.

$G = (V, E)$

## Adjacent Vertices
Two distinct vertices *a* and *b* are said to be adjacent iff. 
$$\{a,b\} \in E$$

## Neighbors
The set of adjacent vertices to some vertex *v*.

## Incidents
Are two vertices joined by an edge.

## Adjacent Edges
Two distinct edges *e* and *d* are said to be adjacent iff. 
$$e \bigcap d \neq \emptyset$$
