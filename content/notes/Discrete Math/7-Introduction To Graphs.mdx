# 1.1 Graphs

## Graphs
A graph *G* is a set of vertices *V* and a set of edges *E*.

$G = (V, E)$

## Adjacent Vertices
Two distinct vertices *a* and *b* are said to be adjacent iff. 
$$\{a,b\} \in E$$

## Neighbors
The set of adjacent vertices to some vertex *v*.

## Incidents
Are two vertices joined by an edge.

## Adjacent Edges
Two distinct edges *e* and *d* are said to be adjacent iff. 
$$e \bigcap d \neq \emptyset$$

## Graph Order
The total number of vertices in a graph.

## Graph Size
The total number of edges in a graph.

## Trivial Graph
A graph that contains only 1 vertex.

## Empty Graph
A graph that contains no edges.

# 1.2 Matrices

## Matrix
A rectangular array of elements.

## Matrix Size
Is the number of columns and rows of a matrix.

## Square Matrix
A matrix where there is a same number of rows as columns.

## Zero-one Matrix
A matrix that contains binary elements only.

## Sum of Matrices
The sum of two matrices A and B is the *m x n* matrix:

$$
A + B = [a_{ij} + b_{ij}]
$$

## Row Matrix
A matrix that contains only a single row.

## Column Matrix
A matrix that contains only a single column.

## Inner Product of Matrices
For a row matrix A and a column matrix B, the inner product of these 
two matrices is:

$$
AB = a_{1}b_{1} + a_{2}b_{2} + ... + a_{n}b_{n} = \Sigma_{i=1}^n a_{i}b_{i}
$$

## Product of Matrices
For a matrix A with a size of *m x n* and a matrix B with a size of *n x p*,
then the product of these two matrices is:

$$
AB = a_{i1}b_{1k} + a_{i2}b_{2k} + ... + a_{ij}b_{jk} = \Sigma_{j=1}^n a_{ij}b_{jk}
$$

## Adjacency Matrix
A square zero-one matrix that denotes vertices that are adjancent to one another.
