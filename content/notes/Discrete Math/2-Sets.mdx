# 2.1 Set Basics

## Set

A collection of objects or elements.

## Cardinality of a Set

The number of elements within a set.

## Set Equality

Two sets are said to be equal if and only if both sets contain the same elements.

## Subset

A set that contains some or all elements of another set.

## Proper Subset

A set that contains some, but not all, elements of another set.

## Empty Set

The set that contains no elements.

## Universal Set

The set with which other sets are considered in.

## Power Set

The set that contains all possible subsets of a given set.

# 2.2 Set Operations

## Union of a Set

Given two general sets A and B: is the set that contains all elements
found in set A or set B.

## Intersection of a Set

Given two general sets A and B: is the set that contains all elements
found in both set A and set B.

## Disjoint Set

Is when two sets have no common elements; forms the empty set when intersected.

## Pairwise Disjoint Set

Is when any pairs of sets have no common elements with each other.

## Difference of a Set

Given two general sets A and B: is the set that contains all elements from A and
are not in B.

## Symmetric Difference of a Set

Given two general sets A and B: is the set that contains all elements from A or B
but not on both.

## Complement of a Set

Is the universal set that contains minus all elements not found in a given set.

# 2.3 Cartesian Products

## Tuple

An ordered collection of objects or elements.

## Cartesian Product of a Set

Given two general sets A and B: is the set that contains tuples where combinations
of elements of A and B are found.

# 2.4 Partitions

## Partition of a Set

Given a set: is the set that contains a non-empty pairwise disjoint subsets of that
given set.
