# 3.1 Mathematical Induction

## Proof by Induction
Is a proof technique that aims to show that a given statement with a sequence of 
infinitely many cases is true by showing first that:

1. The base case is true.
2. For $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, P(n) \Rightarrow P(n + 1)$ is true.

# 3.2 Sequences

## Sequences
A list of terms generated by some expression.

## Geometric Sequences
A sequence that is generated by multiplying each term by a fixed common ratio.

## Arithmetic Sequences
A sequence that is generated by adding each term by a fixed common difference.

## Recursively-Defined Sequences
Are sequences that contain initial terms and where each succeeding term is generated 
from the preceding terms.

## Strings
A finite sequence.
