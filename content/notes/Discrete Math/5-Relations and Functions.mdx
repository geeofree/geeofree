# 5.1 Relations

## Relations
Are sets that contain ordered pairs from two given sets such that each ordered pair 
is said to be related to each other.

## Homogeneous Relations
Is a relational set over a set with its self.

## Relational Properties
Given a homogeneous relation over a set **S**:

1. **Reflexive Relation** $\forall a \in S \to a R a$

2. **Symmetric Relation** $\forall a,b \in S. a R b \to b R a$

3. **Transitive Relation** $\forall a,b,c \in S. a R b \land b R c \to a R c$

# 5.2 Equivalence Relation and Classes

## Equivalence Relation
Is a relation set that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

## Equivalence Classes
For an equivalence relation **R** over a non-empty set **S**:

$$
[a] = \{ x \in S | x R a \}
$$

# 5.2 Functions

## Function
Is a relational set in which one set must map to at most one element to 
the other set.

## Domain
Is the set of inputs for a given function.

## Codomain
Is the set of outputs for a given function.

## Images
Is an element in the codomain from a given element in the domain.

## Ranges
The set of images for a given domain.

# 5.3 Common Functions

## Identity Function
A function that returns the same input as the image.

## Absolute Function
Is a function that returns the same element if that element is a 
positive integer, or the positive integer representation of that 
element if it is a negative integer.

## Ceiling Function
Is the function that returns the closest and largest integer element 
for a given real number.

## Floor Function
Is the function that returns the closest and smallest integer element 
for a given real number.

## Exponential Function
$a^b=c$ where $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}$ and $a \neq 0 \lor a \neq 1$

## Logarithmic Function
$log_ac=b$ where $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}$ and $a \neq 0 \lor a \neq 1$

# 5.4 Function Composition

## Function Composition
Is the concept that the range of one function is the domain of the another function. 
Where the range of the input function must be the subset of the domain of the 
output function.
