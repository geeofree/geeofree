# 5.1 Relations

## Relations
Are sets that contain ordered pairs from two given sets such that each ordered pair 
is said to be related to each other.

## Homogeneous Relations
Is a relational set over a set with its self.

## Relational Properties
Given a homogeneous relation over a set **S**:

1. **Reflexive Relation** $\forall a \in S \to a R a$

2. **Symmetric Relation** $\forall a,b \in S. a R b \to b R a$

3. **Transitive Relation** $\forall a,b,c \in S. a R b \land b R c \to a R c$

# 5.2 Equivalence Relation and Classes

## Equivalence Relation
Is a relation set that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

## Equivalence Classes
For an equivalence relation **R** over a non-empty set **S**:

$$
[a] = \{ x \in S | x R a \}
$$
