# 1.1 Statements

## Statement

A _declarative sentence_ that is either **true** or **false**.

## Open Sentence

A statement that contains variables which indicates its truth value.

# 1.2 Connectives

## Logical Connectives

Is an operation that can be done on one or more statements.

## Negation

A logical connective that is true only when the given statement is false, and
false if the given statement is true.

## Conjunction

Given two statements: is true only when both of these statements are true, false
otherwise.

## Disjunction

Given two statements: is true when at least one of these statements are true, false
if both of these statements are false.

## Disjunction (Exclusive)

Given two statements: at most one of these statements must be true in order for it to
be true, false otherwise.

# 1.3 Laws

## Compound Statements

Are statements that are formed from other statements.

## Logical Equivalency

Is when two compound statements contain the same set of truth values.

## Commutative Law

States that the conjunction or disjunction of two statements is logically equivalent regardless
of their ordering.

## De Morgan's Law

States two things:

1. The negation of a conjunction statement is logically equivalent to the disjunction of the
   two given statements in negation.

   $\lnot(P \land Q) \equiv \lnot P \lor \lnot Q$

2. The negation of a disjunction statement is logically equivalent to the disjunction of the
   two given statements in negation.

   $\lnot(P \lor Q) \equiv \lnot P \land \lnot Q$

## Associative Law

States that the conjunction or disjunction of three (3) or more given statements is logically
equivalent regardless of their ordering.

## Distributive Law

For statements _P_, _Q_, and _R_. This law states two things:

1. $P \land (Q \lor R) \equiv (P \land Q) \lor (P \land R)$
2. $P \lor (Q \land R) \equiv (P \lor Q) \land (P \lor R)$

# 1.4 Implications

## Implication

Is a logical connective in which it contains a hypothesis and conclusion statements where an
implication is said to be false if and only if the hypothesis statement is true but the
conclusion statement is false, true otherwise.

## Converse Implication

An implication's converse is when the given implication's hypothesis is the conclusion and the
given implication's conclusion is the hypothesis.

## Contrapositive Implication

An implication's contrapositive is when the given implication's hypothesis in negation is the
conclusion and the given implication's negated conclusion is the hypothesis

An implication's contrapositive is logically equivalent to it.

## Biconditionals

Is the conjunction of a given implication with its converse.

# 1.5 Tautology and Contradiction

## Tautology

Is when two distinct statements' truth value is always true for any possible given inputs.

## Contradiction

Is when two distinct statements' truth value is always false for any possible given inputs.

# 1.6 Modes

## Modus Ponens

Is the mode of affirming the hypothesis.

## Modus Tollens

Is the mode of denying the conclusion.
